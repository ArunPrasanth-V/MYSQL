### Every RDBMS implements based on this rule
# ATOMICITY :
  > - Either Transaction will happen or not. It should not break or failure in between.
# Consistency
  > - If the information updated in DB It should in real time update
  >  - EG: i'm watching cricket in web app . once the inforation is updated in DB .if i refresh the page it should be updated.
 # Isolation 
  > - Every Transaction should be isolated because there might be interrelated process may happen by result of one transaction another transaction will occure.
 # Durability 
  > - If any chance of machine failure the data should be updated.
  > - data base should give guarantee for updation.
